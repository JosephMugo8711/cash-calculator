## Project Description
A web-based cash calculator to help users calculate the total value of different denominations of currency notes they possess. The calculator allows users to input the number of each denomination of currency notes they have, and it calculates the total cash value in rupees. This tool is useful for quickly counting cash holdings and managing personal finances.

In the future
I will add more currencies to the web-based cash calculator.
